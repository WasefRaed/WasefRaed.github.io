## Machine Learning Classification Pipeline
[Back to Portfolio](/)

### Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using advanced classification algorithms and preprocessing techniques.

### Problem Statement
Built a system to identify customers likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing customer loss.

### Technical Approach

**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using KNN imputation and MICE algorithms
- Detected and treated outliers using IQR, Z-Score, and Isolation Forest
- Applied feature scaling with StandardScaler and RobustScaler
- Performed feature engineering to create meaningful predictors

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Conducted statistical analysis and correlation studies
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Identified key patterns and relationships in the data
- Analyzed feature distributions and target variable balance

**3. Model Development**
- Implemented multiple classification algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and class weighting
- Applied regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

**4. Model Evaluation**
- Achieved 89% accuracy with Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Analyzed confusion matrices and feature importance
- Implemented cross-validation for robust performance estimates

### Technologies Used
